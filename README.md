Find recipes based on ingredients, save favorites

A user can find recipes by simply identifying the main ingredient and the style they would like. 

We use the mealdb API to find the closest recipe options and the user can choose what they would like to cook.

There are checkboxes along the way to make it easier for the user to follow along.

Users may also sign up so they can later save their favorite recipes.
